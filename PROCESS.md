# Technical Exercise Process

Someone from our technical team will grant you access to a private Github repo at a time that's
been pre-arranged with you. The repo will contain the instructions with the problem's description and
(possibly) some code examples.

We suggest you shouldn't need to spend more than 2 hours.

**Note any proposed improvements in `IMPROVEMENTS.md`**. You might identify ways in which your solution,
and/or the codebase in general, can be improved, but not have the time to implement those changes. There
will be an empty `IMPROVEMENTS.md` file in the exercise repository in which you can highlight any such
improvements.

## Process

Before the exercise:

- You should have access to this Primer Repo.
- You should have arranged a date and time for the exercise.

The start of the exercise:

- At the arranged time, your Github user will receive an invitation to a private repository
  containing the Exercise. Keep an eye on your e-mails and Github account. The invite will be sent
  at, or soon after, the arranged time.

During the exercise:

- **IMPORTANT:** Once you have access, you should **immediately fork** the repository. This way we
  can make sure that there won't be any technical issues later for pushing the solution. You should
  ensure your fork is a **private repository** (this is the default Github behaviour).
- You should work on the problem for up to 180 minutes. An incremental Git commit history is
  encouraged but not required.

To submit the exercise:

- A pull request should be created from your fork to the original Cookpad repository. We will only
  consider commits that were created during the 180 minutes window, so **don't forget to push your
  final commit** within the time window. If you prefer to create the pull request to the repo
  immediately, before beginning work on the solution, that is also fine.

## Follow up

1 hour call will be scheduled where the team will discuss the exercise with you, as well as other
Data Engineer, and give you an opportunity to ask questions about Cookpad.
